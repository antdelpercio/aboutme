      <p>I spent the entire summer of 2020 on Lake Hartwell living with my grandparents. In doing so, I was able to do some of my favorite things, like riding jetski's, water tubing, hiking, and just floating around in the lake. We also spent a lot of family time together, playing card, board games, etc. And I was only 15 minutes way from my favorite gym, so I was able to workout every morning!</p>

      <p>When school started in the fall, some of the summer fun came to a halt, and understandably so. I started focusing more on school work, which sadly took me out of the lake and into the living room to focus on that. Day to day life now pretty much consists of going to work in the morning at hte gym, working out when I get off, coming home and doing school work for the rest of the night</p>
